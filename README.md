- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @luissrsan Luis Santiago

 
Looking forward to developing future projects in Computer Graphics as a 2024 Computer Graphics and Imaging Graduate from Lehman College I reflect on such topics that take on media in order to directly communicate my passions as an Artist ,And can move forward having become a CGI Artist with specializations in C4D , software development and Animation . Given the full breadth and depth of production having been able to produce short film animations such a "The Sea Fairy Alien " (2023) and "The Outlight Fairytale" (2024) both heavily self produced films produced from home I can say that my overrall body of  student work encompasses areas In UI/UX , Web Design , Web development , Game Design , Broadcast Design ,Video Editing and production .
