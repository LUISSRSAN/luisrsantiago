Hi im Luis Santiago
I'm interested in Game development,Machine Learning,Robotics and Virtual Reality 
im currently trying to learn python and javascript
but i know that i also have to pick up other stuff like frameworks 
i started with html and css on freecodecamp's Responsive Web Design course 
and then moved on to Angela Yu's Full Stack Development Bootcamp 
after finishing the course i decided to take another one of her courses 
and i am currently taking her 100 Days of Python course on Udemy
